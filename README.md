# EU DCC Validation process

The purpose of this initiative is the automation of the EU DCC validation process. 
## Introduction 
### Validation Cycle 
During the “Validation Cycle” the member states are using their Verifier App and scan the [DCCs in the Quality Assurance](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance) repository. 

* The scanning process will still take place manually. The suggested, in this place, tools would aim to make it easier and will automate the collections, distribution, and analysis of the results.  

### Validation Portal
The creation of a Validation Portal is suggested which will: 
* Allow easy navigation to all reference QR codes.  
* Capture the results from the countries in a comfortable way. 
* Export the results in a standard JSON format.  


## Development instructions 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
